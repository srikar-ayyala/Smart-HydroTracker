## Tech used :

Firebase, React, Chartjs, Javascript, CSS, HTML.

## What is it?
For our IOT Workshop class we made a device that senses the amount of water you have in your water tank at all times and sends the data to firebase's real time database. So I made a website that reads the data and displays it to you if you know your devices device ID, and you can sign-in with your google account in order to save your device list.

## Why?
Well I could have used any thirt party app to get my work done but I made a website in order to Improve my skills as a front end developer and get better at using React and Firebase.

## Features :

1. Sign in using Google
